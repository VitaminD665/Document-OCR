Notes from the document ai overview and whatnot,

there is a doc preparation stage, that uses ocr to extract text and whatnot from text and whatnot
classification that I can add in, maybe more relevant to engineering work and the like
entity extraction, form parser, custom schemas, normalization, training evaluation datasets and whatnot

Processor
A Document AI processor lies between the document file and a ML model that performs the doc
processing and understanding action, classify and whatnot

THese procesors will fit into, digitize OCR, extract, a custom extractor, and pretrained parsers,
classify with custom splitters;

I think the best, at least for the sake of the project will simply to be the OCR to keep it generally
; the documents won't have a specific layout generally, so document ocr makes the most snes ehere for sure

Alright, starting to do the stuff, choosing a processor that is suitable for the use case
1. Choose a processor: Enterprise Document OCR (Optical Character Recognition);
will likely use a pretrained one there

VERSION_ID: "pretrained-ocr-v2.1.1-2025-01-31"

--installing the cloud items? going to watch a few vids from google instead of drowning in documentation... LOL
